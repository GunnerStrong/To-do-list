# To-do-list

## Welcome to my To-do-list

#### I created my own to-do list app. It allows users to add a task to be done and mark a task already done and delete it. This application was made as part of the YouCode online course.

## The following technologies were used in the application: 
HTML, CSS, JS, Grid and Flexbox
